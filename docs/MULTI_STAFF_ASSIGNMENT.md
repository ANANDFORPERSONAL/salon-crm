# Multi-Staff Assignment Feature

## Overview

The Multi-Staff Assignment feature allows a single service to be performed by multiple staff members, with proper accounting of each staff member's contribution. This is essential for services that require multiple people (like hair coloring, spa treatments, etc.) and enables accurate commission calculations and staff performance tracking.

## Features

### ðŸ‘¥ **Multiple Staff Per Service**
- Assign multiple staff members to a single service
- Automatic equal distribution of service contribution
- Visual indication of staff assignments
- Easy addition and removal of staff members

### ðŸ“Š **Contribution Tracking**
- Each staff member's percentage contribution is tracked
- Automatic calculation of individual earnings
- Support for future commission calculations
- Detailed staff performance analytics

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart UI Design**
- Compact dropdown interface that doesn't consume excessive space
- "Add Staff" button for easy staff addition
- Visual staff cards showing assigned members
- Real-time percentage distribution display

### ðŸ”„ **Backward Compatibility**
- Maintains compatibility with single-staff assignments
- Seamless migration from existing data
- Legacy support for existing appointments and sales

## How It Works

### 1. **Staff Selection Process**
```
1. User selects first staff member from dropdown
2. Clicks "Add Staff" to add more staff
3. Additional dropdown appears for more staff selection
4. Selected staff are displayed as compact cards
5. System automatically calculates equal percentages
```

### 2. **Data Structure**
```typescript
interface StaffContribution {
  staffId: string
  staffName: string
  percentage: number  // 0-100
  amount: number      // Calculated based on percentage
}

interface ServiceItem {
  // ... existing fields
  staffContributions?: StaffContribution[]  // New multi-staff support
  staffId?: string                          // Legacy single-staff support
  staffName?: string                        // Legacy single-staff support
}
```

### 3. **Backend Processing**
- **Sales API**: Processes `staffContributions` array
- **Appointments API**: Handles `staffAssignments` with validation
- **Receipts API**: Maintains staff contribution data
- **Validation**: Ensures percentages sum to 100%

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**

#### `MultiStaffSelector` Component
- **Location**: `components/ui/multi-staff-selector.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles multi-staff selection UI
- **Features**:
  - Compact dropdown design (256px width)
  - "Add Staff" functionality
  - Selected staff display cards
  - Automatic percentage calculation
  - Real-time validation

#### `QuickSale` Integration
- **Location**: `components/appointments/quick-sale.tsx`
- **Integration**: Replaces single staff selector
- **Grid Layout**: Adjusted to accommodate 256px dropdown
- **Data Flow**: Maps staff contributions to backend format

### **Backend Models**

#### `Sale` Model Updates
```javascript
const staffContributionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  staffId: { type: String, required: true },
  staffName: { type: String, required: true },
  percentage: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0, max: 100 },
  amount: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0 }
}, { _id: false });

// Added to itemSchema
staffContributions: [staffContributionSchema]
```

#### `Appointment` Model Updates
```javascript
staffAssignments: [{
  staffId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Staff', required: true },
  percentage: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0, max: 100 },
  role: { type: String, default: 'primary' }
}]
```

#### `Receipt` Model Updates
- Similar `staffContributions` array structure
- Maintains legacy `staffId` and `staffName` fields
- Full backward compatibility

### **API Endpoints**

#### Sales API (`/api/sales`)
```javascript
// Processes staffContributions
if (item.staffContributions) {
  item.staffContributions.forEach(contribution => {
    contribution.amount = (item.total * contribution.percentage) / 100
  })
}
```

#### Appointments API (`/api/appointments`)
```javascript
// Validates staffAssignments percentages
const totalPercentage = service.staffAssignments.reduce((sum, assignment) => 
  sum + assignment.percentage, 0
)
if (totalPercentage !== 100) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Staff assignments must sum to 100%' })
}
```
